# Box_plot_for_education-DrivenData

***To compare budget or expenditure data across districts in US***

This is a multi-class-multi-label classification problem with the goal of attaching canonical labels to the freeform text in budget line items. These labels let us/stakeholders understand how schools are spending money and tailor their strategy recommendations to improve outcomes for students, teachers, and administrators.
